# Project Name: Tasking Tasks

## Project Description
This project is designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#, including inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and composition. The goal is to create a functional console application that allows users to manage tasks, with operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing tasks. The project also incorporates SQLite database support for persistent task storage, showcasing proficiency in database integration, software development practices, and version control using GitHub.

## Project Tasks
- **Task 1: Set up the development environment**
  - Install necessary software and tools (e.g., Visual Studio, SQLite)
  - Configure Git and GitHub repository
- **Task 2: Plan the project**
  - Define the project scope and objectives
  - Create a timeline for implementation and testing
- **Task 3: Implement core features**
  - Develop the main functionalities of the application:
    - Task creation and management
    - SQLite database integration
    - Implementing OOP concepts (inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, etc.)
  - Write clean and efficient C# code
- **Task 4: Test the application**
  - Perform unit and integration testing
  - Debug and resolve issues to ensure stability
- **Task 5: Document the project**
  - Create a comprehensive README file
  - Write user and developer documentation
- **Task 6: Finalize and submit**
  - Review and refine the project
  - Tag the final version on GitHub and submit the repository link

## Project Skills Learned
